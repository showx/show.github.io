演唱：筷子兄弟
　　原唱：ありがとう-大桥卓弥
　　那是我日夜思念深深爱着的人呐 I am deep in love with her, thinking of her day and night
　　到底我该如何表达 But how can I express myself
　　她会接受我吗 And will she accept me
　　也许永远都不会跟她说出那句话 Maybe I'll never expose my heart to her
　　注定我要浪迹天涯 For I am always wondering about alone and homeless
　　怎么能有牵挂 How can I be on tenterhooks
　　梦想总是遥不可及 Dreams are but dreams
　　是不是应该放弃 Maybe I should give up
　　花开花落又是一季 Flowers bloom and fade again and again
　　春天啊你在哪里 But where is the spring for me
　　青春如同奔流的江河 Youth like a swift current
　　一去不回来不及道别 Rushing by without saying good-bye
　　只剩下麻木的我没有了当年的热血 Leaving me behind, numb cold spent
　　看那漫天飘零的花朵 A beautiful flower faded, at its prime time in spring
　　在最美丽的时刻凋谢 At its prime time in spring
　　有谁会记得这世界她来过But who cares if it ever lived in this world
　　转眼过去多年时间 Many years have elapsed in a brink of the eye
　　多少离合悲欢 Witnessing unions and departures, joys and sorrows
　　曾经志在四方少年 The wondering boy envies the wild goose
　　羡慕南飞的雁 That flies to his home in the south before winter comes
　　各自奔前程的身影匆匆渐行渐远 People go in different directions, away and gone
　　未来在哪里平凡 But where is my future, just simple, ordinary days for me
　　啊谁给我答案 Oh, who can give me the answer
　　那时陪伴我的人啊你们如今在何方 Where are you, the girl who used to sit by my side
　　我曾经爱过的人啊现在是什么模样 Are you still beautiful and lovely, as the girl in my memory
　　当初的愿望实现了吗 Have you realized your dreams
　　事到如今只好祭奠吗 Maybe we'll let byfones be bygones
　　任岁月风干理想再也找不回真的我 However hard I may try, I cannot find my true self
　　抬头仰望这满天星河 A million stars are twinkling in the sky, and I try to find out the one
　　那时候陪伴我的那颗 That used to stay by me, oh my dear companion of yesterday
　　这里的故事你是否还记得 Do you still remember the time we shared together
　　生活像一把无情刻刀 Life, like a sculptor's graver, cold and ruthless
　　改变了我们模样 has changed our shape
　　未曾绽放就要枯萎吗 Will the flower wither before it ever has a chance to bloom
　　我有过梦想 But I used to have my dream
　　青春如同奔流的江河 Youth like a swift current
　　一去不回来不及道别 rushing by without saying goodbye
　　只剩下麻木的我没有了当年的热血 Leaving me behind, numb, cold, spent
　　看那漫天飘零的花朵 A beautiful flower faded
　　在最美丽的时刻凋谢 At its prime time in spring
　　有谁会记得这世界她曾经来过But who cares if it ever lived in this world
　　当初的愿望实现了吗 Have you realized your dreams
　　事到如今只好祭奠吗 Maybe we'll let byfones be bygones
　　任岁月风干理想再也找不回真的我 However hard I may try, I cannot find my true self
　　抬头仰望这满天星河 A million stars are twinkling in the sky, and I try to find out the one
　　那时候陪伴我的那颗 That used to stay by me, oh my dear companion of yesterday
　　这里的故事你是否还记得 Do you still remember the happening here before
　　如果有明天祝福你亲爱的 If tomorrow ever comes, I'll send my best wishes to you, my dear girl
