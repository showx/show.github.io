最后一步sudo make && make install 的时候提示找不到 /usr/local/pcre.h这个文件，
主要复制一下文件到这个目录就可以解决了。

Mac OS X: pcre.h: No such file or directory

Whilst struggling with installing oauth.so on the LAMP stack on my Mac, I came across this particular annoyance.
Running “sudo pecl install oauth” would download, unpack and start building the extension, however at a certain part of the process it would fail, whining about “pcre.h” not existing.

So I did what I do best; spent a few hours figuring out what was going wrong. 
My first step was to download & install MacPorts, then run a few installations. (You may have to restart terminal after installing MacPorts for ‘port’ commands to work)

sudo port install autoconf
sudo port install pcre
sudo cp /opt/local/include/pcre.h /usr/include/
Although “sudo port install autoconf” isn’t mandatory in this one, it will probably be necessary sooner or later if you’re installing modules & extensions.

Now when I ran “sudo pecl install oauth”, The command ran through without any errors! Although that was not the end of my problems with installing oauth.so on a Mac…
